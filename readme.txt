== Description ==

Web push notifications are the digital marketing world's newest best friend. They allow you to send instant notifications, similar to those found on your smartphone to your subscribers' devices. This is an ideal solution for marketers looking for a new and very effective channel to reach your audience about news, sales, order status, special offers, empty shopping cart links, new content, events or anything else you can think of.

After setup, your visitors can opt-in to receive push notifications when you publish a new post, add new content, have a special sale and visitors receive these notifications even after they've left your website.

= Are web push notifications really free? =

Yes, they are free until you reach a certain subscriber count. Until you reach that subscriber count you can send as many notifications as you want!

We're confident that once you start paying for an account, that means your traffic is getting bigger and your ROI on Subscribers should easily cover the monthly fees.

= Do I need an Apple or Google Developer account to sign up? =

Nope, we take care of all of that.

= Will it work on HTTP and HTTPS sites?

Yes, it works on both and we will be adding in additional functionality to continue to give users of both types of sites the best experience possible.

= Do my subscribers have to create an account with me or with Subscribers to get the push notifications? =

No they don't have to do either. It's a simple one-click subscription service for them and they're done. They can also unsubscribe any time they want through their browser.

= I am unable to locate my Site ID on Subscribers.com, what should I do? =

Your Site ID is displayed on the Install Code page. In the top menu of your dashboard look for the small icon next to the Send Notification button. This will take you to the Install Code page. From there, look for the Wordpress option and click on it. You'll then see your Site ID under this page and you can copy it straight from here.

= Do I need to install it for all my websites separately? =

Yes, the plugin needs to be installed separately on each of your websites. If you have more than one website you manage, you will want to Add a Site on your Subscribers account or sign up for a new account with a different username
